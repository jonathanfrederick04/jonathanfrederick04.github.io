### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I got to work with pricing and math problems in coding. I had the chance to create equations and make calculations based on the price of a pizza. Overall, I really enjoyed working on this lab with my partner.


* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because I got to work with units of conversion in coding. I got to learn how to convert different units in the metric system with units of measurement in the US. I really liked this lab and had a fun time working on this lab with my partner.


* Lab 4

    And finally, Lab 7, part 1 is also one of my favorite labs. I liked this lab because it involved a guessing game in where you had to guess a certain number to see whether you got it right or not. I enjoy guessing games and I had a good time implementing it in a code.
